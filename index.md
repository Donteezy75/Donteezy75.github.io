## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2 part- 1
This was an exciting lab because it helped build the foundation for using string text and using different things I type in the terminal to print different outputs. It was a fairly simple lab that helped show how you can do different things with the terminal and code when they interact.

 * Lab 12 part -2
This lab was fun and it put everything we learned into 1 and created a beautiful image. The best part was using the command line arguments and creating our own name for it. It showed me a very important part of programming is knowing the fundamentals and basics.

* Lab 6 part -2

This lab was special to me due to the fact that I like blackjack. This is the first time where I saw programming being applicable to me as instead of showing someone how this works I could show them this program so they can learn the game of blackjack. This program involved us using multiple if statements to account for multiple cards and cases to ensure the program ran smoothly and could easily tell which card belonged to which.
